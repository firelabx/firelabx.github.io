# what is OKR?

> OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal system used by Google and 
> others. It is a simple tool to create alignment and engagement around 
> measurable goals.

**The big difference from traditional planning methods?** 
OKRs are frequently set, tracked, and re-evaluated – usually quarterly. 
OKR is a simple, fast-cadence process that engages each team’s 
perspective and creativity.

Creating alignment in the organization is one of the main [OKR benefits](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/okr-benefits/). The goal is to ensure everyone is going in the same direction, with clear priorities, in a constant rhythm.

## The Components of OKRs

*I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).*

**Objectives** are memorable qualitative descriptions of what you 
want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging.
An Objective should motivate and challenge the team.

**Key Results** are a set of metrics that measure your progress 
towards the Objective. For each Objective, you should have a set of 2 to
5 Key Results. More than that and no one will remember them.

> “If it does not have a number, it is not a Key Result.”

## What’s unique about OKR?

There is not a single way to use OKR, each company or team can adapt and
tweak it, creating different versions of it. But there are some core 
concepts:

### Agile Goals

Instead of using annual static planning, OKR takes an agile approach. By
using shorter goal cycles, companies can adapt and respond to change.



### Simplicity

Using OKR is straightforward, and the OKRs themselves are easy to  understand. Intel’s original model set goals monthly, which required a  lightweight process.

Companies that adopt OKR reduce the time  spent setting goals from months to days. As a result, they invest their  resources in achieving their goals and not on setting them.



### Transparency

The primary purpose of OKR is to create  alignment in the organization. To do so, OKRs are public to all company  levels — everyone has access to everyone else’s OKRs. The CEO’s OKRs  usually are available on the Intranet.



### Nested Cadences

OKR understands that strategy and tactics  have different natural tempos since the latter tends to change much  faster. To solve this, OKR adopts different rhythms:

- A strategic cadence with high-level, longer term OKRs for the company (usually annual).
- A tactical cadence with shorter term OKRs for the teams (usually quarterly).
- An operational cadence for [OKR tracking results](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/tracking-okr-results/) and initiatives (usually weekly).



### Bidirectional Goal Setting

The traditional top-down cascading model takes too much time and does not add value. As [Laszlo Bock](https://twitter.com/laszlobock2718), Google’s former VP of People Operations wrote in his book [Work Rules!](https://www.workrules.net):

> “Having  goals improves performance. Spending hours cascading goals up and down  the company, however, does not. It takes way too much time and it’s too  hard to make sure all the goals line up. ”

That is why [OKRs do not cascade](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/okrs-not-cascade/).  OKR uses a market-based approach that is simultaneously bottom-up and  top-down. The company sets the strategic OKRs that each team should use  to draft their tactical OKRs.

Tactical OKRs should align to the  company strategy to the other teams. In a typical company, around 60% of  the OKRs are set bottom-up in agreement with the managers.

This  model improves engagement while creating a better understanding of the  strategy. It also makes the process simpler and faster as you won’t  spend time “cascading goals up and down.”



### Ambitious Goals: Moonshots and Stretch Goals

The philosophy behind OKR is that if the company is always reaching 100% of the goals, they are too easy.

Instead,  OKR targets bold, ambitious goals. Besides aspirational objectives, OKR  believes in enabling the team to set challenging goals. Goals that make  the team rethink the way they work to reach peak performance.

Ambitious goals are so important that Google’s “Ten things we know to be true.” mentions them directly:

> “We  set ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet because we know that by  stretching to meet them we can get further than we expected.”

OKR’s ambitious goals are known as[ moonshots or stretch goals](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/understanding-stretch-goals/). The usual recommendation is that in average you should achieve only 60-70% of them.

But that does not apply to all OKRs, as some goals should be predictable. That is why is important to [understand the difference between moonshots and roofshots.](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/understanding-stretch-goals/)



### Decoupling Rewards

[Separating OKRs from compensation and promotions is crucial to enable ambitious goals](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/why-you-should-separate-okr-and-compensation/).  Employees need to know they will not lose money if they set ambitious  goals. It is hard to set moonshots when you need the bonus to pay for  your kids’ college.

Companies should reward employees based on their impact on the business. As [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove), Intel’s former CEO, wrote in his book [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK/):

> “[OKR] should be just one input used to determine how well an individual is doing.”

OKR is a management tool, not an employee evaluation tool.

## Adopting OKR

[Adopting OKR is a journey](https://felipecastro.com/en/blog/okr-journey-guide-adoption/),  not an event. As in any cultural transformation, change does not happen  overnight. But it is possible to modify the company’s dynamics in a few  months, aligning and engaging the team.

Furthermore, you should customize OKR to your organization, [as this framework explains](https://resources.felipecastro.com/leveraging-okr-2).



## Common OKR mistakes

**1) Using OKR as a task list.**

Use OKR to measure if you are adding value, not if you are delivering tasks. Therefore, you need to [understand the difference between Value-based and Activity-based Key Results](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/success-criteria-types-key-results/).

**2) Setting too many OKRs.**

This  mistake is a common consequence of the first one. Rather than being a  laundry list of every single thing you do, OKR lists your top  priorities. OKR is your definition of what most important during that  quarter.

Even if you are using Value-based Key Results, you need focus, or your team will not remember their OKRs.

**3) Not aligning your OKRs**

OKR is an alignment tool, so you should never set your OKRs in isolation. You have to talk to the other teams.

**4) “Set it and Forget it.”**

OKRs are not New Year Resolutions. Without regular follow-through, you will never achieve them.

## Tips for writing good OKRs

For Objectives:

- First  of all, Objectives should be simple, short and easy to memorize. If you  have to stop to breathe while reading your Objective, you are doing it  wrong.
- Second, Objectives shouldn’t be boring. They can fit the  organizational culture and be informal and fun. You can use slangs,  internal jokes and even profanity – whatever fits your culture.

For Key Results:

- Separate metrics from initiatives
- Set few of them. Usually between 2 and 5 per objective.
